# usecure Tech Test

To run dev mode;

```
npm run dev
```

## Plan

1. Build initial repo, tech stack setup etc
1. Create API for getting data
1. Add setup for pages
1. Create course slides page
1. Create pass | fail page

## TODO

Would do these to "complete the task" if I had more time, but it's late, I'm tired, and I'm moving house next week!

- Add global state using zustand to track score and maybe slides(not sure if slides needed atm though)
- Prettify the score page, not even sure how I'd do that background yet!
- put nice icons in place of radio button parts
- Write better code, this is a mess, especially the colors part this is a bit all over
- improve tailwind styles, they're also messy
